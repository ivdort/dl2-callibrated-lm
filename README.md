# Setup

## Environment setup

## Dataset generation
Seeing as we have created two small datasets, these can either be generated from scratch using generation.py (for the math dataset) and 5W_generation.py (for the 5W dataset), both found in the dataset folder, or the full datasets can be found in the same folder, named 'math_dataset_1_to_10_no_div.csv' and '5W_dataset.csv' respectively.

## Math model

## 5W model

## Abstract-title model
